                        <h2>Aspiring Software Engineer.</h2>
                        <p>I am a self-driven individual with a genuine passion for software engineering. I am captivated by the intricacies of coding and the endless possibilities it offers. I have already taken steps to immerse myself in this field by completing courses on platforms like FreeCodeCamp and CS50 from Harvard online. These courses have further enhanced my skills and knowledge in software engineering, providing me with valuable insights and practical experience. Recognizing the strong connection between technology and modern-day software engineering, I have also taken foundational courses on SoloLearn, focusing on HTML and CSS. I am thrilled to apply my expanding knowledge and passion to contribute to this dynamic industry.</p>
